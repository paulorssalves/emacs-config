** Internal linking
*** I can create links in the following way: 
    This link goes to the [[Capture][Capture headline]].
*** And then I can create another headline 
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: showoff123
    :END:
    heyyy

*** And then I can call it
    Like [[named_item][this]] 
    This, however, only works on headlines with content inside them. Dunno why.
**** And give it a name like below:
    #+NAME: named_item 
    Hey, apple
*** I can also create links like this:
    I can give something a custom ID. In the "and then I can create another headline" headline I wrote for it a custom ID. I can go to it through [[#showoff123][this]] link.
*** There is also something called "Radio targets". 
    If I write down the name Lewin, for example, it will create links everywhere the name "Lewin" is written, an they will point to where the <<<radio>>> target is..
** External linking 
*** Besides linking to websites, files and whatnot, I can also create links for other notes within my org environment.
    Like [[id:2497c794-95f6-43cd-998d-cb72d1126772][this]]

    You can activate follow mode in the evil-agenda with shif+f or F
